# Cordite architecture

This document describes how the engine is put together and why. The working rules
derived from it are in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Shape of the engine

Cordite is a set of static libraries, one per module, that are linked into two kinds of
executable: the editor, used to build games, and the runtime, which runs an exported
game and contains no editing code.

```
            editor (executable)          runtime (executable)
                      \                    /
                       +---- engine modules (static libraries) ----+
                       |  ...                                      |
                       |  math                                     |
                       |  core                                     |
                       +-------------------------------------------+
```

Modules form a strict layering: a module may use only the modules it lists as
dependencies, and their dependencies. The `module_layering` test enforces this by
scanning `#include` lines, so an accidental upward dependency fails the build instead
of slowly turning the code base into a ball of mud.

### Modules

| Module | Depends on | Responsibility |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| `core` | -         | Services every other module needs: logging, assertions, error handling, hashing, UUIDs, JSON and binary serialization, file I/O, configuration, the job system, memory allocators, timing, platform queries. |
| `math` | `core`    | glm type aliases and conventions; `Transform`, bounding volumes, rays and intersection tests, frustum culling, projection matrices, color conversions, keyframed curves, deterministic random numbers. |

Further modules (platform, rendering, assets, world, physics, audio, scripting, editor)
are added by the later milestones and will be listed here as they land.

## Conventions

- **Coordinates:** right-handed, +Y up, metres. Identity rotation faces -Z.
- **Matrices:** column-major, column vectors, `world = parent * local`.
- **Clip space:** Direct3D-style, x and y in [-1, 1] with +Y up, depth in [0, 1].
  NVRHI flips the Vulkan viewport so the same matrices work on every backend.
- **Depth:** reversed (near = 1, far = 0) for scene rendering, for uniform precision.
- **Angles:** radians in code, degrees in files and user interfaces.
- **Color:** linear RGB in all math; sRGB only at storage and display boundaries.
- **Text:** UTF-8 everywhere, including file paths in data.
- **Identity:** assets and entities are identified by `Uuid`, never by path or name.

## Design decisions

Each entry records a choice that is not obvious from the code, and why it was made.

### Dependencies are fetched as archives pinned by SHA-256

CMake `FetchContent` downloads each dependency from a fixed URL and verifies its hash.
Git branches and tags are mutable, so tracking them would make builds unreproducible
and would let a compromised upstream change what we compile. Archives are also much
faster to fetch than full git histories. Git submodules were rejected because they
need an extra checkout step that is easy to forget, and vcpkg/Conan because they add a
tool every developer and CI machine must install first.

### The build needs only a C++ compiler, CMake and Ninja

No Python, no package manager, no SDK installers. `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` fetches CMake
and Ninja on Windows machines that only have Visual Studio. Dependencies whose build
needs extra tools are avoided.

### The C runtime is linked statically on Windows

Exported games must run on a clean machine without installing the Visual C++
redistributable. Every dependency is built from source with the same setting, so there
is exactly one runtime in the process.

### Expected failures return `Result`, not exceptions

`Result<T>` (an alias of `tl::expected`) makes failure part of a function's signature,
so a caller cannot forget that loading a file may fail. Exceptions remain enabled
because several dependencies use them, but they are caught at the boundary where they
arise and converted. `std::expected` was not used because it needs C++23, which the
three supported standard libraries do not yet implement equally.

### Assertions are for programmer errors only

`CORDITE_ASSERT` disappears in `Release`. Anything that can happen because of data or
user input is an expected failure and returns a `Result`. The assertion handler is
replaceable; tests install one that throws, so failure paths are testable without
killing the test process.

### Logging goes through a small facade over spdlog

Engine code logs with `CORDITE_LOG_*` and never includes spdlog. The facade adds what
the engine needs on top of spdlog's sinks: a category per message, a bounded in-memory
history for the editor console and the automation API, and listeners. Console output
goes to stderr so that stdout stays free for machine-readable output from tools.

### The job system wraps enkiTS

enkiTS is a small, widely used task scheduler. It is hidden behind `JobSystem` with a
pimpl so the rest of the engine depends on three functions (`parallelFor`, `submit`,
`wait`) rather than on a scheduler library. An exception escaping a job is captured and
rethrown to whoever waits, or logged if nobody does, so a failing job is never silent.

### Custom allocators instead of `std::pmr`

`LinearAllocator` and `PoolAllocator` are a few dozen lines each and cover the two
patterns the engine needs: per-frame scratch memory and many same-sized objects.
`std::pmr` would do the same, but its implementation lives in the standard library
binary on macOS and would raise the minimum supported macOS version.

### JSON keeps key order

`Json` is `nlohmann::ordered_json`. Scene, material and settings files are edited by
people and agents and stored in version control, so their layout must be stable and
readable: fields appear in the order the engine writes them rather than alphabetically.

### Deterministic random numbers

`Random` implements PCG32 directly instead of using `<random>`, whose distributions
produce different values on each standard library. Gameplay, procedural content and
image-comparison tests need the same sequence on every platform. The implementation is
verified against the reference generator's published output.

### Enum names use `nameOf`, not `toString`

doctest stringifies values by calling an unqualified `toString`, which finds any
overload in the value's namespace by argument-dependent lookup and then fails to
compile because the return type is not doctest's string. Using a different verb avoids
the collision without wrapping every enum in the tests.
